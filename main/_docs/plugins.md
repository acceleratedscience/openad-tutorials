# OpenAD Plugins

<!-- about_plugin -->

Plugins are how molecular tools and AI models are made available to the OpenAD client. They provide drastically simplified access to a series of advanced tools, and they make it easy for your own Python applications to interface with OpenAD.

Creating your own plugins is easy if you have a basic understanding of Python.

### Creating Your Own Plugin

You can create your first plugin in just minutes. This creates the ability for your own projects (or your favorite tools) to access OpenAD's powerful visualisation capabilities and more.

We will be publishing a detailed tutorial soon on this page.
