# OpenAD Model Service

The OpenAD model service lets you run machine learning models without the technical overhead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Run inference in the cloud instead of locally.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Deploy ML models as services with minimal setup.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Seamless integration with OpenAD Toolkit CLI and notebooks.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✅ &nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on using models, not managing infrastructure.
