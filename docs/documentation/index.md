OpenAD is an open-source framework developed by IBM Research, aggregating a number of molecular science toolkits into a single API that can be accessed by command line, a Jupyter Notebook and (soon) an API.

The goal of openAD is to provide a common language for scientists to interact with a multitude of of molecular tools to simplify the triage process and drastically accelerate your development timelines.

## Toolkits

The OpenAD Beta integrates with the following IBM Research [toolkits]({% link base-concepts.md %}#toolkits):

-   ### [DS4SD](https://ds4sd.github.io/)

    _Deep Search for Scientific Discovery_<br>
    Connecting & ingesting unstructured data<br>
    [DS4SD Docs](https://ds4sd.github.io/deepsearch-toolkit/)
    {: .no-gap }
    <details markdown="block">
    <summary>More</summary>
    <div>
        <p>The Deep Search toolkit uses AI to convert unstructured PDF documents into structured JSON files and enables you to automate knowledge extraction.</p>
        <p>You can use it for both public and proprietary documents.</p>
    </div>
    </details>

-   ### [RXN](https://rxn.res.ibm.com/)

    Computational Chemistry<br>
    [RXN Video tutorials](https://rxn.app.accelerate.science/rxn/learn) (account required)
    {: .no-gap }
    <details markdown="block">
    <summary>More</summary>
    <div>
        <p>The Reaction toolkit uses AI to predict chemical reactions, retrosynthesis pathways and experimental procedures.</p>
        <p>You can train AI models to build intelligence in your specific chemistry domain, and scale your analysis and model training while securing your data using features of the Discovery Platform.</p>
    </div>
    </details>

-   ### [GT4SD](https://github.com/GT4SD/gt4sd-core)

    <span class="mini-label">Coming soon</span><br>
    _Generative Toolkit for Scientific Discovery_<br>
    Molecular modeling & inferences
    {: .no-gap }
    <details markdown="block">
    <summary>More</summary>
    <div>
        The Generative Toolkit accelerates hypothesis generation in the scientific discovery process. It provides a library for making state-of-the-art generative AI models easier to use.

-   ### [ST4SD](https://st4sd.github.io/overview/)

    <span class="mini-label">Coming soon</span><br>
    _Simulation Toolkit for Scientific Discovery_<br>
    Virtual Experiments
    {: .no-gap }
    <details markdown="block">
    <summary>More</summary>
    <div>
        <p>The Simulation Toolkit simplifies the development, execution and dissemination of virtual experiments.</p>
        <p>A virtual experiment is an application workflow which measures one or more characteristics of one or more input systems. It is the computational analog of a lab experiment.</p>
